<h2>
  Integration with `pulp_python`
  Updated: 2019/04/14
</h2>

<h4>Organization of document</h4>

  <p>
    This document is a high level overview and quick reference for the state of the Python plugin,
    organized by relevence to potential integrations. This should be useful for initial planning,
      but will not be updated frequently. For tracking the progress of the plugin, please see the
      <a href="https://pulp.plan.io/projects/pulp/wiki/Pulp_Python_Roadmap">Python Roadmap</a>.

          Not necessarily a blocker, but integration will go more smoothly if this is done before
          implementation begins. Likely to contain backwards incompatible changes.

              Tarballs, eggs, and whls produced with `twine` can be uploaded to Pulp as
              `Artfiacts`. A POST to `PythonContent` referencing the artifact will generate a
              PythonContent unit, which can then be added/removed to/from `Repositories`. </br>

                Lifecycling is done entirely with the `pulpcore` feature `Distributions`, which are

                documentation in `pulpcore` docs cover this. </br>

                We have decided not to implement python-specific distributions in the 3.y line.
                This may affect some wishlist features, but is acceptable for initial release.</br>

      <p>
        Work listed here is not yet complete. If any of these are necessary for an integration

            <a href="https://pulp.plan.io/issues/4698">Minor Planned Backwards incompatible change</a>.</br>
            The Remote contains all of the features necessary to sync from PyPI. Red because it
            contains fields that are not used. These should be removed before any integration
            begins. </br>

          The Publish workflow will change for all (or most) plugins, which will affect an
          initial implementation.</br>

            <div class="content">
              <a href="https://pulp.plan.io/issues/985">Redmine Issue</a>.</br>
              User must provide a list of packages they want to sync. Full PyPI sync is planned
              and has relatively low complexity and risk, and can probably be implented
              quickly. Since this is a very large sync, this should be done after lazy is
              implemented. Does not need to block starting integration. </br>

              Unfortunately, it will probably not perform well. To use PyPI's `simple
              API`, a full sync of 175,954 projects will require 175,954 metadata requests and
              an order of magnitude more package requests. The total (as of June, 2018) is 2 TB
              of total download space, not including database. </br>

              Some minor improvements can improve performance here. They are covered as separate
              gaps:
              <ol>
                <li>lazy</li>
                <li>Download metadata in parallel</li>
                <li>Incremental sync</li>
              </ol></br>

          <div class="content">
            <a href="https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1884">Redmine Issue</a>.</br>
            Yellow, because it should not block initial implementation, but will be a high value
            feature and should be completed before integration is complete. </br>

            Lazy sync has not been implemented. Python's first stage may need to be refactored to
            accomidate this. The Python team will need to investigate how much work is
            necessary.</br>
            <b>Low Complexity</b>

            <a href="https://pulp.plan.io/issues/4132">Redmine Issue</a>.</br>
            Yellow because this will slow down sync dramatically. Faster syncs will be easier to
            work with, but not strictly necessary.</br>
            <b>Medium Complexity</b>
          </div>

            Incremental sync is not implemented or planned and is (semi) <b>blocked upstream</b>.
            <a href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/284">Warehouse Issue</a>.</br>

            PyPI (warehouse) will need to move to its next generation REST API, which will
            improve the situation for syncing. It will be cached (fast) upstream, and will open
            the door for Incremental sync. Thus, the initial sync will still be slow, but
            subsequent syncs will only update projects that have changed upstream. I have a
            functional skeleton of this API implemented, but I need to spend some time on it
            before I can merge and get adoption on PyPI itself. This work is definitely doable,
            but the upstream community can be slow to respond, so <b>if this is a priority, it
            should be promoted now.</b> Otherwise, this can be considered "green".</br>

            This is yellow because it will block capsule sync, which is assumed to be a required
            feature. This does not need to block initial implementation. This feature is complete
            for Pulp 2 and can be ported easily.</br>

      <b>Documentation State</b>
      <p>
        Overall, the pulp-python docs are in a very good place. They have good structure, and are a
        huge improvement on Pulp 2. Because they are published on read-the-docs along with its REST
        API reference docs, they should be significantly easier to use than pulp-file was.

          <div class="content">
            Every "major feature" (sync, upload, add/remove, publish, and host) is covered with a

            docs.

              This might "just work" for free. We need to check and see. If it works, we need to
              add functional tests.

              In the future, we are interested in supporting the Python packaging tool `twine`,
              which is how users upload their packages to PyPI. Ideally, they could use twine to
              upload into Pulp as well. This feature is relatively unresearched though, and could
              be tricky. If the plugin is integrated with a GUI like Katello, I would guess that
              users would rather just click an "Upload" button like any other plugin. (Do we want
              to behave like other content types, or do we want to behave like PyPI?)
